# Contribution guidelines

## Making a pull-request

- Before making a more complex pull-request make sure to open an issue beforehand if it does not exist yet. This allows for a preliminary discussion before the pull-request is initially submitted. This often eliminates unnecessary work.
- Please, mark the PR as `draft` if you plan to add some work in the future.
- Pull-request requires at least one approval to be merged into the `master` branch.
- Refer to relevant issue if it's there.
- Make sure the conflicts with `master` are resolved.
- The author of the pull-request is responsible for merging it if they have sufficient privileges.

## Issues

Please, check if some issues about your topic already exist before making a new issue. Continue the discussion in the old issue if it's there, or refer to it.

## Checking if things work

It is encouraged to play around and check if the new features work and nothing is broken before submitting the pull-request.
