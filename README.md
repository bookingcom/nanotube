Nanotube: data router for Graphite
=================================

This is the router (or relay, or reverse-proxy) for Graphite. It routes incoming records according to the specified rules. Nanotube is designed for high-load systems. It is used at Booking.com to route up to `400k` incoming and `1.2M` outgoing records/sec on a single box.

Record structure
----------------

The only supported protocol is [line](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol). The records should follow the structure:
```
path.path.path value datetime
```

Config
------

Please refer to the sample configs in the _config_ folder for examples and documenation.

Design
------

Please refer to the design doc _docs/design.md_.


Record validation and normalization
-----------------------------------

It is possible to turn on record normalization with the `NormalizeRecords` option in general configuration. It is on by default.

Validation checks performed are:

- does the record consist of three fields
- is value in a record a valid real number
- is time in the record a valid epoch

Normalizations performed are mainly for backward compatibility with `carbon-c-relay`, namely:

- Double or more subsequent dots in path are converted to a single dot. E.g. _a.b..c_ -> _a.b.c_
- Prefix and trailing dots in path are removed. E.g. _.a.b.c._ -> _a.b.c_
- Spaces in record are normalized to a single space character. E.g. _a.b.c␣␣␣1.23<tab>1234567_ -> _a.b.c␣1.23␣1234567_
- Chars not in `[0-9a-zA-Z-_:#]` are replaced with `_`. Tags have their own allowed chars and are not supported for now.


Running with docker-compose
-----------------------------------

Run the input stack `nanotube` -> `go-carbon-*` and the query stack to check on those inputs `carbonapi` -> `zipper` -> `go-carbon`
with:

```
docker-compose up
```

You can feed in sample data with:

```
echo "test1.test 5 $(date +%s)" | nc -c localhost 2003
```
As many netcat implementations exist, a parameter may be needed to instruct nc to close the socket once data is sent. Such param will usually be -q0, -c or -N. Refer to your nc implementation man page to determine it.

get it back with:

```
seq 8080 8081 | xargs -I {port} curl "localhost:{port}/render/?target=test1.test&format=json&from=$(( $(date +%s) - 300 ))&until=$(date +%s)"
```

To test the second store (alone or in conjunction) change the metric path to test2.test or test1.test2
