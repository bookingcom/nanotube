Nanotube: data router for Graphite
=================================

This is the router (or relay, or reverse-proxy) for Graphite. It routes incoming records according to the specified rules. The Nanotube is designed for high-load systems. It is used at Booking.com to route up to `400k` incoming and `1.2M` outgoing records/sec on a single box.

Build and run
-------------

1. Get this repository with
`go get -u github.com/bookingcom/nanotube`
2. Navigate to it and run
`make`
3. Run it with

`./nanotube -config config/config.toml

Running with docker-compose
-----------------------------------

Run the full setup including input stack `nanotube` and `go-carbon` with:

```
docker-compose up
```

You can feed in sample data with:

```
echo "test1.test 5 $(date +%s)" | nc -c localhost 2003
```
As many netcat implementations exist, a parameter may be needed to instruct it to close the socket once data is sent. Such param will usually be -q0, -c or -N. Refer to your implementation man page.

Get it back with:

```
seq 8080 8081 | xargs -I {port} curl "localhost:{port}/render/?target=test1.test&format=json&from=$(( $(date +%s) - 300 ))&until=$(date +%s)"
```

To test the second store (alone or in conjunction) change the metric path to `test2.test` or `test1.test2`.

Record structure
----------------

The only supported protocol is [line](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol). The records should follow the structure:
```
path.path.path value datetime
```

Config
------

Please refer to the sample configs in the _config_ folder for examples and documentation.

Record validation and normalization
-----------------------------------

Nanotube validates every record it receives. Validation checks performed are:

- does the record consist of three fields
- is value in a record a valid real number
- is time in the record a valid epoch

It is possible to turn on record normalization with the `NormalizeRecords` option in general configuration. It is on by default. Normalizations performed are mainly for backward compatibility with `carbon-c-relay`, namely:

- Double or more subsequent dots in path are converted to a single dot: _a.b..c_ -> _a.b.c_
- Prefix and trailing dots in path are removed: _.a.b.c._ -> _a.b.c_
- Spaces in record are normalized to a single space character: _a.b.c␣␣␣1.23<tab>1234567_ -> _a.b.c␣1.23␣1234567_
- Characters not in the set `[0-9a-zA-Z-_:#]` are replaced with `_`. Tags have their own allowed chars but are not supported for now.

Tags support
------------

Tags are not supported for now. See https://github.com/bookingcom/nanotube/issues/4

Design
------

Please refer to the design doc _docs/design.md_.
