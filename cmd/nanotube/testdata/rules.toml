# Routing rules.
# - all routing rules are applied to each incoming record;
# - when regex in the rule matches, the record is sent to the clusters in the "clusters" list;
# - many rules can be matched to each record;
# - each record can be sent to a cluster at most once. If two rules send it to same cluster, only one instance will be sent;
# - cluster names must be from the set defined in the clusters config
